            <h6>RIGHT OF CONFIRMATION</h6>

            <p>
              Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller the confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning him or her are being processed. If a data subject wishes to avail himself of this right of confirmation, he or she may, at any time, contact the controller.
            </p>

            <h6>
              RIGHT OF ACCESS
            </h6>
            <p>
              Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller free information about his or her personal data stored at any time and a copy of this information.
            </p>
            <p>
              The data subject shall have a right to obtain information as to whether personal data are transferred to a third country or to an international organisation. Where this is the case, the data subject shall have the right to be informed of the appropriate safeguards relating to the transfer.
            </p>
            <p>
              If a data subject wishes to avail himself of this right of access, he or she may, at any time, contact the controller.
            </p>



            <h6>
              RIGHT TO RECTIFICATION
            </h6>
            <p>
              Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller without undue delay the rectification of inaccurate personal data concerning him or her. Taking into account the purposes of the processing, the data subject shall have the right to have incomplete personal data completed, including by means of providing a supplementary statement.
            </p>
            <p>
              If a data subject wishes to exercise this right to rectification, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the controller.
            </p>

            <h6>
              RIGHT TO BE FORGOTTEN
            </h6>
            <p>
              Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data concerning him or her without undue delay, and the controller shall have the obligation to erase personal data without undue delay.
            </p>

            <h6>
              RIGHT OF RESTRICTION OF PROCESSING
            </h6>
            <p>
              Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller restriction of processing if the accuracy of the personal data is contested by the data subject, for a period enabling the controller to verify the accuracy of the personal data; if the processing is unlawful and the data subject opposes the erasure of the personal data and requests instead the restriction of their use instead, and if the controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of the processing.
            </p>

            <h6>
              RIGHT TO DATA PORTABILITY
            </h6>
            <p>

            <h6>
              RIGHT TO OBJECT
            </h6>

            <p>
              Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to object, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, at any time, to processing of personal data concerning him or her. The Company shall no longer process the personal data in the event of the objection, unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject, or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
            </p>

            <h6>
              RIGHT TO AUTOMATED INDIVIDUAL DECISION-MAKING
            </h6>
            <p>
              Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning him or her, or similarly significantly affects him or her.
            </p>

            <h6>
              RIGHT TO WITHDRAW DATA PROTECTION CONSENT
            </h6>
            <p>
              Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to withdraw his or her consent to processing of his or her personal data at any time.
